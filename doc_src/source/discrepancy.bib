We present near-linear-time approximation algorithms for the hitting set problem in the following geometric settings: (i)                                                                           {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}R{\}}{\$}                 is a set of planar regions with small union complexity. (ii)                                                                           {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}R{\}}{\$}                 is a set of axis-parallel d-dimensional boxes in ℝ                  d                . In both cases X is either the entire ℝ                  d                , or a finite set of points in ℝ                  d                . The approximation factors yielded by the algorithm are small; they are either the same as, or within very small factors off the best factors known to be computable in polynomial time.},

	Abstract = {We prove a theorem on partitioning point sets inEd (d fixed) and give an efficient construction of partition trees based on it. This yields a simplex range searching structure with linear space,O(n logn) deterministic preprocessing time, andO(n1−1/d(logn)O(1)) query time. WithO(nlogn) preprocessing time, where $\delta$ is an arbitrary positive constant, a more complicated data structure yields query timeO(n1−1/d(log logn)O(1)). This attains the lower bounds due to Chazelle [C1] up to polylogarithmic factors, improving and simplifying previous results of Chazelleet al. [CSW].},

abstract = "The approximation of arbitrary two-dimensional curves by polygons is an importanttechnique in image processing. For many applications, the apparent ideal procedure is to represent lines and boundaries by means of polygons with minimum number of vertices and satisfying a given fit criterion. In this paper, an approximation algorithm is presented which uses an iterative method to produce polygons with a small—but not minimum—number of vertices that lie on the given curve. The maximum distance of the curve from the approximating polygon is chosen as the fit criterion. The results obtained justify the abandonment of the minimum-vertices criterion which is computationally much more expensive."
